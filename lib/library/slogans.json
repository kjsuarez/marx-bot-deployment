      "Abolish the wages system!",
      "Bigger cages! Longer chains!",
      "For the many, not the few",
      "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need",
      "It is done",
      "¡Hasta la victoria siempre!",

      "The withering away of the state.",
      "The goal of socialism is communism.",
      "Fascism is capitalism in decay.",
      "A lie told often enough becomes the truth.",
      "Sometimes - history needs a push.",
      "Give us the child for 8 years and it will be a Bolshevik forever.",
      "It is true that liberty is precious; so precious that it must be carefully rationed.",
      "No amount of political freedom will satisfy the hungry masses.",
      "The most important thing when ill is to never lose heart.",
      "Without a revolutionary theory there cannot be a revolutionary movement.",

      "States are not moral agents, people are, and can impose moral standards on powerful institutions.",
      "Debt is a trap, especially student debt, which is enormous, far larger than credit card debt. It’s a trap for the rest of your life because the laws are designed so that you can’t get out of it. If a business, say, gets in too much debt, it can declare bankruptcy, but individuals can almost never be relieved of student debt through bankruptcy.",
      "When there is state there can be no freedom, but when there is freedom there will be no state.",

      "If money is the bond binding me to human life, binding society to me, connecting me with nature and man, is not money the bond of all bonds? Can it not dissolve and bind all ties? Is it not, therefore, also the universal agent of separation?",
      "When education is not liberating, the dream of the oppressed is to become the oppressor",
      "Leaders who do not act dialogically, but insist on imposing their decisions, do not organize the people--they manipulate them.",
      "Shoot these rabid dogs. Death to this gang who hide their ferocious teeth, their eagle claws, from the people! Down with that vulture Trotsky, from whose mouth a bloody venom drips, putrefying the great ideals of Marxism!",
      "Down with these abject animals! Let's put an end once and for all to these miserable hybrids of foxes and pigs, these stinking corpses! Let's exterminate the mad dogs of capitalism, who want to tear to pieces the flower of our new Soviet nation! Let's push the bestial hatred they bear our leaders back down their own throats!",
      "All power to the Soviets!"
